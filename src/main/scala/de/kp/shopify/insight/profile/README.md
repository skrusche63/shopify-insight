## Profile Subsystem

The *profile* subsystem builds a customer purchase profile from multiple aspects
of the customer purchase behavior:

* Customer Type

The customer purchase profile comprise the customer type derived from RFM segmentation, the 
respective attributes, recency, frequency and monetary, and also the specification of the 
associated (individual) segments.

E.g. monetary segmentation divides the customer base due to their total amounts spent into 
segments from 1 to 5, where 5 specifies a customer with the highest business value.

* Customer Loyalty

The customer purchase profile describes the loyalty segment the customer is assigned to due to 
his or her last purchase behavior. Loyalty segmentation divides the customer base into segments 
from 1 to 4, where 1 describes churners and 4 the most loyal customers.

* Customer Personas

Every customer is unique, but customer purchase behavior shows that customers can be divided into
groups that have similar purchase pattern.
 
This predictive analytics platform evaluates the customers' purchase history and leverages 
machine learning techniques to determine customers with the most similar behavior, personas.

Personas are built from the purchase time behavior, and also from the products customers 
buy over their lifetime.

Product based personas segments the customer base into groups of customers that buy similar items. 
Such segments can be used e.g. to target emails on types of products likely to appeal to this  
group of customers.

The products that are assigned to best describe a certain persona can also be used to improve 
cross-selling efforts by taking related products into account. Product relations are a result 
of learning from products that are often purchased together.

Personas based on the purchase time behavior divides the customer base into groups of customers 
that prefer similar days of the week and hours of the day when purchasing. This information improves 
targeting to address the right customer at the right time.

Personas are also built from the *time to repeat purchase* and helps to segment customers due to 
their repeat purchase patterns.  


A customer profile combines results from RFM segmentation, loyalty and persona analysis, and provides 
advanced insights into the customer's behavior and preferences. This is the most appropriate starting 
point for any further customer engagement strategies.
