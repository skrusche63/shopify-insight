## Predict Subsystem

### RFM Prediction

The repeated RFM processing of the *prepare* subsystem create a time series of recency, 
frequency and monetary attributes for every single customer and customer type.

This information is used by the *predict* subsystem to forecast the recency, frequency and 
monetary attributes for a certain customer type (segment) and a specific period of time.

Forecasts can be made for a specific number of days, weeks, months and years.
