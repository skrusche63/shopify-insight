## Collect Subsystem

The *collect* subsystem connects to a store platforms (Shopify) leveraging the associated 
REST API and collects customer, product and order data on a weekly or other predefined
time base. These data are used to feed appropriate Elasticsearch indexes.

The *collect* phase defines the starting point of a set of data processing phases that aim 
to evaluate the customers' purchase history to extract valuable business insights, provide 
product recommendations, or, forecast customers' lifetime value and next purchase, and more.

One of the main advantages using Elasticsearch as a means to collect or gather data from a store 
platform is, that one can search these data leveraging all the features of this advanced search
engine.
